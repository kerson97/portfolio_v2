      <p>
        I love learning new things, solving problems creatively, and
        collaborating with talented people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I obtained a diploma in Business Administration at Okanagan College and
        now reside in Victoria where I've spent the last years attending UVic
        obtaining my Computer Science degree. I enjoyed my time at university
        and I look forward to building my skills further in a professional
        environment. It's important to me that my future work is meaningful,
        challenging and collaborative!

        I'm currently working on various projects to fine tune my skills. I love
        smooth, crisp UI's that are minimal, impactive and responsive. My full
        stack projects aim to pair beautiful UI's with efficient back-ends to
        match.

        I had the priveledge of growing up in Kelowna British Columbia, making
        countless friends and memories along the way.

      <p>
        I spend my free time immersing myself in my many passions. I love hiking
        and camping, reading, fishing, meditation/yoga, fitness, playing
        kendama, gaming, and programming to name a few. Known to pair many of
        these with good company and craft beer drinking! <br />
