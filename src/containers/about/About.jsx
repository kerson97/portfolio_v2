      <p>
        My names Carson and I love to learn new things, I love to solve
        problems, I love working with people and I love to have fun.

      <p>
        I had the priveledge of growing up in Kelowna British Columbia, making
        countless friends and memories along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        I now reside in Victoria where I've spent the last few years attending
        UVic obtaining my Bachelors of Computer Science degree. I loved my time
        at university and I look forward to putting my skills to the test (and
        learning more!) in a professional environment. It's important to me that
        my future work is both meaningful as well as challenging!
      </p>

      <p>
        I spend my free time immersing myself in my various hobbies and
        passions. I love hiking and camping, reading, fishing, yoga/fitness,
        playing kendama, snowboarding, gaming, and programming to name a few.
        Known to combine many of these with craft beer drinking! <br />
