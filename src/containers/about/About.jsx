      <p>
        I now reside in Victoria where I've spent the last few years attending
        UVic in pursuit of a Bachelors of Computer Science degree. As much as
        I've loved my time at university I look forward to putting my skills to
        the test in a professional environment.

        I spend my free time immersing myself in my various hobbies and
        passions. I love hiking and camping, reading, fishing, yoga/fitness,
        playing kendama, gaming and programming to name a few. <br /> Not a
        moment goes by where I'm not busy doing something!
