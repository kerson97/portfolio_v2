      <p>
        I now reside in Victoria where I've spent the last few years attending
        UVic obtaining my Bachelors of Computer Science degree. I loved my time
        at university and I look forward to putting my skills to the test in a
        professional environment.

        I spend my free time immersing myself in my various hobbies and
        passions. I love hiking and camping, reading, fishing, yoga/fitness,
        playing kendama, gaming and programming to name a few. Have mastered the
        arts of combining many of these with craft beer drinking! <br />
